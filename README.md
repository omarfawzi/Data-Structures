# Data Structures

This Repository focuses on exposing how data structures works internally instead of relying directly on C++ std library .

This repository classifies data-structures into :

1 - Linear Data Structures </br>
2 - Non Linear Data Structures <br/>

### Linear Data Structures
- Lists (100%)
  - Linked List (100%)
  - Double Linked List (100%)
- Stack (100%)
- Queue (100%)

### Non Linear Data Structures
- Trees (0%)
  - Min Heap (100%)
  - Max Heap (100%)
  - Binary Search Tree (0%)
  - Balanced Binary Search Tree (AVL) (0%)
  - B Tree (0%)
  - Red Black Tree (0%)
  - Interval Tree (0%)
  - Segment Tree (0%)

Further benchmarks will be added introducing time and space complexity for each data structure.
